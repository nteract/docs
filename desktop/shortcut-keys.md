|In this section nteract requires multi-keystroke nav through the menus rather than a single shortcut key. In many cases we could add the shortcut key though value feels very marginal. |
|Interrupt Kernel | I, I | I, I | Alt+R, I | Not sure this works w/ Almond |
|Shutdown Kernel |  |  | Alt+R, K | Could add Ctrl+K. But Jupyter doesn't have a default binding here so only makes sense if we're doing the whole menu for consistency. Then we end up eating up a bunch of bindings that might be more useful for other things in the future (TBC, long term, would love to see user/admin-configurable bindings, but we aren't there yet). |
|Restart Kernel | 0, 0 (zero, zero) | 0, 0 (zero, zero) | Alt+R, R | Lab and Notebook prompt user to confirm; they do not instantly restart. Could add Ctrl+R. Currently that does a Chromium page reload; would need to ask Kyle if that's important to any of his dev workflows in the desktop app. |
|Restart Kernel and Clear |  |  | Alt+R, C | Ctrl+C can't be used here (copies text to clipboard); so maybe need this whole section of items to use Ctrl+Shift instead? Again there's no Jupyter binding here. |
|Restart Kernel and Run All |  |  | Alt+R, A | There's no Jupyter default here, only included because my users want one. |
