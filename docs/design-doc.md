title: nteract Design document
---

This document attempts to specify the goal for an nteract core package that can
provide generic/core state management to all notebook-y applications. Right now
this is focused on these apps:

* Desktop
* nteract on jupyter
* `@nteract/play`
* notebook on next

This describes a pretty far and wide overhaul of our core logic, including the
notebook itself.

## Intention

We want to have a set of basic functionality and UI components that we can share
across multiple apps.

Right now it's a bit messy since there are some old unused bits as well as
some desktop-specific pieces. We'll get to work on making a maintainable suite
that we're happy to work with across web, jupyter serverextension, and desktop.

## Core concepts

* `ref` - an internal _reference_ to an entity upon _recognition_, e.g. kernels, hosts, kernelspec collections, etc.
* `id` - likely an external identifier, e.g. with /api/kernels/9092, 9092 is the id

We use the term _recognition_ over _creation_ because we want to have a way to
reference an entity _before_ we get a response from some api. A good example is
having a _ref_ for an active kernel before the kernel has been launched with a
jupyter notebook server. Since there will be a proliferation of id-strings, the
internal ones are called _ref_s and they are only meant for use inside the
application--i.e., they have no meaning externally. The external id-string that
will typically be found is called `id`.

---

Side note -- In flow, this would be typed as:

```js
opaque type Id = string;
opaque type Ref = string;
```

Which can also help us enforce we are using the right ids and refs amongst disparate entities:

```js
opaque type KernelId = Id;
```

## Flattened Structure, Database Like Feeling

Stemming from the Redux docs'
[Normalizing State Shape](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html),
we setup our application to be collections of entries built in a relational
fashion. We were doing something similar with `cellMap` (map of cell id to cell)
and `cellOrder` (list of cell ids). We're taking it to the next level here.

## The Proposed Structure

```flow js
opaque type Id = string;
opaque type Ref = string;

type core = {

  // The core state is meant to be document-centric. So, we basically use the
  // currently selected document to set the context for the rest of the app.
  // This model may need to change when twe have things like split panes and
  // support objects in core that are not really considered *documents*.
  selectedContentRef: Ref

  // The piece of state that allows the ui to show loading/error indicators.
  // This is split apart from the entities definitions because the two parts of
  // state serve very different purposes.
  communication: {
    preferences: {
      loading: boolean,
      saving: boolean,
      error: ?Object
    },
